## 🧠 About the Project

This project was born from the intersection of geometry, physics, and artistic curiosity.
It explores the beauty of mathematical motion using parametric equations that describe circular paths — similar to those used in classic spirograph toys.

- The code was developed incrementally to:
- Strengthen Python and mathematical modeling skills
- Integrate data visualization with creative algorithms
- Produce unique, reproducible digital art

# Spirograph Generator 🌀

A Python project to generate interactive **Spirograph-like curves** using parametric equations. The program calculates points for hypotrochoid curves and plots them interactively using matplotlib, allowing users to explore a wide variety of shapes by adjusting parameters.

---

## Features ✅

- Interactive command-line interface to input:

- Radius of the fixed circle (R)

- Radius of the rolling circle (r)

- Distance from the rolling circle's center to the drawing point (d)

- Automatic scaling for very small or large parameters to maintain precision.

- Progressive drawing animation of the Spirograph.

- Option to save the resulting curve as PNG or JPG.

- Graceful handling of Ctrl+C interruptions with confirmation to exit or resume.

---

## Usage 🛠️

1. git clone https://github.com/Lerocko/spirograph.git
2. cd spirograph
3. python Spirograph_250610.py
4. Follow the prompts to generate and save Spirographs.

## Example Output 🎨

Include screenshots or animated GIFs to illustrate the generated Spirographs. For example:

## Future Improvements 🚀

- Support for more fractal and L-system curves.

- Export vector formats (SVG) for higher-quality graphics.

- GUI interface for live parameter adjustment.

- Enhanced customization: colors, line styles, and animation speed.
